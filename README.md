## About

Canta-ng is a attempt to rewrite the singstar-like game/learning software canta with the usage of blender game engine and python 3.x.

## Why?

Canta was written with usage of soya3d as 3d-engine.
That did lead to several problems, but the most important right now is, that it did not got maintained very well.
Therefore it is very difficult to get it running, even under varius linux distributions and its nearly impossible to get it running under windows.
There are much more reasons, like better developer plattform, migration to a python3 code base, and also because I was bored ;)

## Dependencies

-   blender

-   mutagenx  (installable with python3-pip)

-   python-configobj

-   [song "Bruder Jakob"](https://github.com/spiderbit/canta-media)   (copy it either to media/songs in the project root or to ~/.canta/songs)

## Start

1.  run from the console and keep it open: blender game.blend

2.  then move into the field with the cube

3.  press: "p"

4.  if you want to quit before it reaches the end of the song/demo press: "ESC"
